Syntax

[capture](parameters) -> return_type {
    // function body
}


Capture Clause:

[ ]: An empty capture clause indicates that the lambda function does not capture any external variables.
[var]: Captures a specific variable by value.
[&var]: Captures a specific variable by reference.
[=]: Captures all external variables by value.
[&]: Captures all external variables by reference.

Definition:

A lambda function is an anonymous function defined using a concise syntax introduced in C++11.

Advantages:

Highlight the advantages of lambda functions, such as brevity, improved readability, and the ability to create functions on the fly.

Compatibility:

Mention that lambda functions are part of the C++11 standard and later versions.



important points


Mutable Lambdas:

If you capture variables by value, they are treated as constants within the lambda. The mutable keyword allows you to modify them
int x = 5;
auto increment = [x]() mutable {
    x++;
    std::cout << x << "\n";
};
increment(); // Outputs 6
